#### is basically a python code for various sensors. This file pasted here for just code understanding. 
#### If you're using ButtonPython folder then there's no need to use this code. Because the code is already put into the ButtonPython and Embeddedwith Django

#### You can use Raspberry Pi 3/4 or Arduino Uno board to run all the sensors simultaneously. We recommend for Raspberry Pi because it can useful to run
#### the whole programming structure as well as sensors. Face Mask Detection and Social Distance detection can be used in Raspberry Pi 3 and above model.
#### Also it can run the sensors and create it own LAN network for Data Visualization.

## Hand Sanitizer Dispenser 
#### We provided the code already. To use this just read the pin mapping the used in code and run the program once.
#### It will run forever.
